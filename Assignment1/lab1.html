        <p><b>Lab 1</b> is the first CIS 2336 assignment that we have to submit. It demonstrates the understanding and
            ability to write basic pages in HTML.</p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, most websites are developed with some PHP/JS framework, like
            <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> or <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>,
            because writing HTML files from scratch kinda sucks. But hey, you gotta start somewhere!<br>
            However, there's still some really important websites that still utilize basic HTML/CSS usage, such as the
            <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">PNG library</a>.<br>
        </p>

            Old Geocities page that was archived
            -->
            <img src="img/lab1_geocities.gif"
                onclick="location.href = 'https://web.archive.org/web/20091025055025/http://geocities.com/buddysplace2002/'"
                alt="Cool Geocities GIF I found" title="Cool Geocities GIF I found">
            <figcaption>
                <a href="https://gifcities.org/">
                    Search engine archive of old geocities GIFs+Websites from back then.
                </a>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Pure HTML/CSS websites use to be more popular back then, especially when Geocities was still around. There's
            a really niche aesthetic that these old websites have that I find interesting.<br>
            As time goes on, HTML's importance is superseded by all of the different web libraries that generate the
            markup for you.
